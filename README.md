Don't let your Spotify data go to waste! Log your raw listening, store your bookmarked songs/albums/artists, and develop your own smart features.

## Problem Statement
Spotify contains data about the users saved artists, albums, and songs, which constitutes a library. 
A person's library is a valuable part of their identify, accrued over time. 
However, anecdotal experience has shown that sometime items will disappear from a user's library.
